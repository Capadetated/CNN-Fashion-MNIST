# CNN-Fashion-MNIST

A CNN predictive analysis of the Fashion MNIST Dataset.

This was a Python-based project using 8 CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) models to predict whether an image belonged to one of ten classes (T-shirt, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, or Ankle Boot). 8 models were generated in order to show the effectiveness of tuning particular parameters or using tools from Keras. The best model had a 91.73% accuracy.

"Assignment4_Fitch.pdf" contains the text of the analysis along with the supporting figures and tables. "Model_Fashion_MNIST_Database_Master.ipynb" contains the dataset.
